# Rainmeter Quotes/Lyrics display
This widget displays some song lyrics from a txt file. The current time interval for each lyric is 10 minutes.

I forked the original repository and added formatting from another widget I had on my desktop. I also added the option to change the lyric by double clicking the widget.

## Adding Lyrics
Open the `List of quotes.txt` file and add your lyrics to it. Each lyric should be separated by `<end>`.
If you want to change the delimiter, go to Quotes Viewer.ini and change `Separator="<end>"` to whichever characters you prefer.

## Notice about old files
I have retained the old txt for quotes called `listOfQuotes.txt`. You can replace the `PathName` in `Quotes Viewer.ini` and change `Separator="<end>"` to `Separator=":"` if you want to make use of it.
