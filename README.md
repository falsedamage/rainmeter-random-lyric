# Rainmeter Quotes/Lyrics display
This widget displays some song lyrics from a txt file. The current interval for each lyric is 10 minutes.

I forked the original repository and added formatting from another widget I had on my desktop.

## Adding Lyrics
Open the text file and add your lyrics to it. Each lyric should be separated by `<end>`.
If you want to change the delimiter, go to Quotes Viewer.ini and change `Separator="<end>"` to whichever characters you prefer.
