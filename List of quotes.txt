That moonlight that shines on me at dawn, it’s still the same as then, a lot changed in my life, but that moonlight is still the same.<end>
If you think you’re gonna crash, accelerate even harder, you idiot.<end>
Crazy that you'd think that my success has a connection to your failure.<end>
Polarization is the ugliest flower in the world.<end>
The world is a giant system in it, either opposition, war, or survival is inserted.<end>
In a sick world, a person that is well is treated as a mutant, isn't it strange?<end>
In a world with its eyes closed, a person with theirs open now they are made blind, isn't it strange?<end>
Someone who wishes for peace, someone who wishes for war, they are each at the extremes of their ideologies, isn't it strange? <end>
They tell you to have dreams, though no one has it, there are no answers, isn't it strange?<end>
You think you got taste? Oh babe, how do you know? I mean for God's sake, everything's under control.<end>
The choices you’ve been given are all preferences controlled by the capital.<end>
No matter how much money is in your grasp, everyone's a slave to this system.<end>
Polarization, the flower that's already bloomed, a round nail that has been hammered into a square hole. Even so, I roll on, somehow, like this, in each of their chicken coops, everyone claims they are fine.<end>
In a world with its eyes closed, a person with theirs open, I think it's more strange that only they have theirs open.<end>
There’s no answer, that’s the answer.<end>
I grow old, and learn about the world. Even so, could it have been better if I knew nothing of the world.<end>
Guess I'm slowly becoming an adult, I can't remember. What was it that I wanted? Now I'm scared. Where have the fragments of my dream gone?<end>
Thought I would change after I turn twenty, thought I would change after I graduate.<end>
The life I'd hoped for, the life I'd wanted, just that kind of life, I don't care now how it turns out anymore.<end>
Now I've become an adult who finds it hard to grasp my dream, and that's growing up.<end>
What kind of person am I? Am I a good person? Or a bad person? The assessments are all different, I’m just a person, too.<end>
There is nothing that lasts forever in this world, everything is just a happening that passes by.<end>
So what? What if you get hurt? Sometimes you might get hurt again. Sometimes you might shed tears upset, so what? What if you live like that?<end>
People are like that, when you’re not there, you want to be there, and when you are, you don’t want to.<end>
Who said people are animals of wisdom? For me, obviously, we are animals of regret.<end>
Your ordinary became my special, your special became my ordinary.<end>
My ordinary became your special, my special became your ordinary.<end>
I'd eat just enough and sleep, well, though I'm unable to sleep, I'll worry about tomorrow's things tomorrow, fuck I don't care.<end>
Oh yeah, money, honor, wealth, the trophies and stadiums, sometimes I'm scared of them, I'd felt like I wanted to run away.<end>
Well, it doesn't matter. Tomorrow comes again and gets dark. Me that's like this, you that's like that, well we're just enduring another day.<end>
Set me free, yeah, even though I know it won't turn out however I want to.<end>
Had I caught you that day
No, had I stopped you that day
To this day would we
Still be friends??How would it be?<end>
Dear my friend, how have you been?
I'm doing great, you know, yeah
Dear my friend, I'll be honest
I still freaking hate you<end>
"With the two of us, the world is nothing scary"
We said, and now we walk two completely different paths, damn<end>
The ambition we had of conquering the world
We were young and had big dreams, only twenty
Sudden cutting off contact<end>
Was it you who changed? Or was it me? Uh
I hate this flowing time, it's us who changed
Hey, I hate you, hey, I don't like you
Hey, even as I say these words, I miss you<end>
The you I used to know is gone and the me you used to know is gone
I know it's not just because of time that we changed
The me you knew is gone and the you I knew is gone
It's not just because of time that we changed and I feel so empty<end>
It’s really a bitch to not have something you want to do
I know that it seems pathetic
To not have a dream like everyone<end>
“Everything’s going to be alright if you go to university
And do as we tell you”
I’m the asshole for believing those words
I'm living because I can’t die<end>
Everyone is running but why am I the only one still here?<end>
Dream, you will fully bloom
After all the hardships
Dream, your beginnings will seem humble
So prosperous will your future be<end>
I hope everything disappears when I’m alone
I hope things disappear like mirage
I hope things disappear
I hope my damn self disappears<end>
When the second and minute hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o'clock
And you're gonna be happy<end>
Yes, it's all in the past
But even saying that to myself isn't easy
Is it my fault? Is it my wrong?
Only my echo comes back with no answer<end>
Put my hands together to pray
Hoping that tomorrow
I'll laugh a little more, for me
It'll be better, for me<end>
I'm the one I should love in this world
Shining me, precious soul of mine
I finally realized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful<end>
I'm shaking and afraid but I keep going forward
I'm meeting the real you, hidden in the storm
Why did I want to hide my precious self like this?
What was I so afraid of?<end>
I may be a bit blunt, I may lack some things
I may not have that shy glow around me
But this is me
My arms, my legs, my heart, my soul<end>
